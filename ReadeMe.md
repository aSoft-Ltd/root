# /Root

This is the mother repo of all repositories at asoft

## Motive of /root

Since we are still a small startup, maintaining and updating our open source libs
has been challenging. On every release, we experience tremendous drag which really
needs addressing.

With this repo, we can treat all our libraries as submodules and update them with a script easily
